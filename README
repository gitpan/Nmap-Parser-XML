Nmap/Parser/XML version 0.66_1
============================

nmap xml output parser in perl

This module is intended to sift through the nmap scan outputs in xml form,
either by passing a filehandle that is being piped from a current nmap scan
or passing an xml filename that is the output of the of using the '-oX file.xml'
option. It uses the XML::Twig library, which is memory efficient and fast.
In the authors opinion, this module is very easy to use to extract information
from an nmap xml scan output about the scan itself and the hosts that were
scanned.

I am trying to balance efficiency with ease of use. If you think something
can be done differently send your feedback.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.0+

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version onward.

CHANGES



Changes from 0.66 to 0.66_1
        - previous versions (0.64 or earlier) of the parser, no arguments
	to tcp_ports and udp_ports would return the whole hashref of all the
	ports, this is now deprecated. Use the newly created functions
	tcp_service_name, tcp_service_proto, tcp_service_rpcnum,
	udp_service_name, udp_service_proto, and udp_service_rpcnum.
	- passing a port number to tcp_ports and udp_ports returns the state
	of the port.
	- documentation changes
	- changed default filter for solaris to include 'sun' and not 'sunos'
	- more example scripts
	- no more wantarray usage for tcp_ports and udp_ports
